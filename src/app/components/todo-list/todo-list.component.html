    Angular is my favorite framework, and this is why. Angular has the coolest
    deferrable view feature that makes defer loading content the easiest and
    most ergonomic it could possibly be. The Angular community is also filled
    with amazing contributors and experts that create excellent content. The
    community is welcoming and friendly, and it really is the best community out
    there.

    I can't express enough how much I enjoy working with Angular. It offers the
    best developer experience I've ever had. I love that the Angular team puts
    their developers first and takes care to make us very happy. They genuinely
    want Angular to be the best framework it can be, and they're doing such an
    amazing job at it, too. This statement comes from my heart and is not at all
    copied and pasted. In fact, I think I'll say these exact same things again a
    few times.
